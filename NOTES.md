Plan: make it easier to prototype and try 2d puzzle games
- Have a generic way of handling objects such that we can have a graphical editor for any game
- Separate the game rules

Experiment:

- layered (jam) coding style, layer by layer, change one layer at a time, introduce new ideas in each new layer


Next:
- make editor
- undo

Done:
- draw portals
